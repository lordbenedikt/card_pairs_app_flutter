# Recollectopia - privacy policy

This app collects some user, only after user consent. On account creation the user sets an email address and password,
used for user authentification. Any user can create groups. The group owner (the creator) can add other app users as
group members. <br>
<br>
The app allows the creation of card sets, which consists of a set of fotos, a title and a cover foto, all determined 
by the user. These card sets are immediately available to all members of the group. To create these card sets, the app
may access the device camera, storage, or images provided by another app, none of which will happen withouth the users
immediate knowledge and permission.<br>
<br>
Any user data will be deleted at request.<br>
